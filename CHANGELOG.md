## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-02

First public release — a native macOS todo + Pomodoro app with a bundled MCP
server for Claude Code.

### Added
- **Projects → Tasks.** Group work into projects; each task has a title, detail
  notes, an optional link, and a Todo / In Progress / Done status.
- **Subtasks.** One-level nesting with per-parent progress, checkboxes, and MCP
  support.
- **Recurring tasks.** Completing a recurring task spawns its next occurrence.
- **Task dependencies.** Blocked-by relationships with cycle guard, UI badges,
  and a blocked-guard enforced across all views.
- **Due-date reminders.** Local notifications scheduled for task due dates.
- **Time estimates.** Per-task estimates with estimate-vs-actual comparison.
- **Reusable task templates.** Save and reuse task shapes across the app and MCP.
- **Kanban board.** Drag-and-drop board view with a list/board toggle.
- **Live search.** In-memory search/filter bar for the task list.
- **Stats dashboard.** Sidebar dashboard with per-day and per-project stats.
- **Global Pomodoro timer.** One focus timer for the session (25/5/15), with a
  MenuBarExtra showing a live countdown and controls.
- **Claude Code integration.** Bundled MCP server lets Claude create, edit,
  delete, and update tasks.

### Distribution
- Pure-Swift build (`swiftc`, no Xcode/SPM), ad-hoc code-signed. ~860 KB app,
  ~450 KB DMG.
- CI (`release.yml`) builds a universal DMG on `v*` tags and publishes it to the
  public releases repo.
